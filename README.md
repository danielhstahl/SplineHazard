# Lossengine

## Description

This is a C++ engine applying the PD, LGD, and loan contribution models.  It can output CNLs and CULs for any time on books and can predict losses for any calendar month.  Documentation using [doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/index.html "doxygen").  


## Install -- Dev

Requires Visual Studio 2015.  By default, uses C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\VC\vcvarsall.bat.  
In the root of the project, run the following commands in order:

`git clone https://github.com/miloyip/rapidjson.git`

`make`  This compiles the program into Main.exe.  If vcvarsall.bat lives in a different directory than C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\VC\, change the make.bat file to point to the directory.

### Documentation generator

`doxygen lossforecasting`  Generates docs into docs/html and docs/latex

## Install -- Prod/Release
TBD!  

### Testing
Must run `test` and then AppTest.exe to ensure that it passes all tests on deploy.

## How to use
The engine communicates over JSON using callbacks.  To send a message to the program, write to the "out" pipe with a string in the following format:

`{"endPointKey":{"id":"yourUniqueId", "data":yourDataObject}}`

Where `endPointKey` is one of `init`, `simulate`, `getParamQueries`, `reset`, `getUnitLoss`,  `getNetForecast`, `getUnitForecast`, `getCUL`, `getCNL`.  These are defined in main.cpp.  `init` must be called first.

`yourUniqueId` is an id which lets a program know which function is being returned.  For example, this is can be generated by a uuid generator.  

The structure of `data` varies depending on the endpoint.  

If there is no error, the engine will return a JSON string in the following format on the "in" pipe:

`{"yourUniqueId": returnedDataObject}`

In the case of an error, the JSON is returned on the "err" pipe and is in the following format:

`{"yourUniqueId": "errDescription"}`

It is recommended that the user create a function in the calling program to automatically filter this data.
